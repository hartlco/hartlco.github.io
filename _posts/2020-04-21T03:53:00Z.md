In my full-time job, I'm working on a project that was started almost 12 years ago. I have no illusion that I would be able to compile and run this on Xcode for iPad.
In my spare time, I'm building a pure SwiftUI App with a few external SwiftPM dependencies, no custom build scripts besides SwiftLint, no interface builder. I don't see why it wouldn't be great to work on this on the iPad.
