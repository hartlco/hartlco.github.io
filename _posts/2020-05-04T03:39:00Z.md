Iâ€™m reintroducing the cell swipe-actions in the latest [Icro beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/GRnUIus6). I use the iOS 13 long-press context menu wherever possible and overestimated the general adoption.
I hope iOS 14 brings speed and discoverability improvements to the context menus to drive the adoption.
