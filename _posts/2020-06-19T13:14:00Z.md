I have 0 interest in another proprietary E-Mail host/App. 

Own your domain and use public protocols.

App Store guidelines need to be just and mutual beneficial. The playing field should be as even as possible.

Side-loading of notarized Apps could drive new innovation on many areas.

Apple, why are you fighting this battle now?
